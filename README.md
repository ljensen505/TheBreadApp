<h4>Known Issues:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>it's ugly</li>
        <li>While the math works, it could probably be streamlined</li>
        <li>If a liquid is used in place of water (such as milk), there will be unexpected results.  Using milk isn't recommended anyway though because of how long this dough takes to rise.</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Requirements:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Python3</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Notes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Everything is in grams. Including "g" in your input is optional. 1000g == 1000</li>
        <li>You need experience making sourdough. Timings will be off, but dough volume increases should be the same.  This program won't give you detailed instructions - it only converts your ingredient list.</li>
    </ul>
